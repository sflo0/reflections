It is much easier to compare 2 files using diff or FC.  FC is windows based, ran in cmd prompt.
it uses the naming scheme FC old_file.txt new_file.txt
diff us mac/linux based, it can be run in git bash.  it uses the naming scheme:
diff -u old_file.txt new_file.txt

it will only be helpful if everything is on the same lines.

multiple versions help us so we can compare what was sone, and what was changed

choosing when to manually save/commit gives me the power.  i can save when i see fit, and allows me to make comments on what was changed since the last save.

git allows you to add multiple files to a repo and commit/save them all at once.  this is helpful because
may times you will be using multiple files when coding a project.

command: git log - shows all commits in to the file.
command: git diff ID1 ID2 - shows the differences between 2 specific instance id's

by checking out commits i can see how the game worked in previous versions.  if a bug is introduced i can pinpoint
where it happened.  this means if i accidently break something, i will be able to fix it with ease.

i wanna use git do do become a better programmer.
